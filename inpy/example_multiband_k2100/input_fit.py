#Input file for multi-band fitting of K2-100b
#As it appears in Barragan et al., 2019 (https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/490/1/698/5569669) 
#Created by Oscar Barragan, March 2021.

#The multi-band aproach is similar to the multi-instrument RV fit, where we have to include the band (instrument)
#label in the fourth column in the input file

#File name with the light curve data
#Note that there are four columns ordered as:
#time, normalised flux, normalised flux error, instrument/band label
fname_tr = ['multi_band_K2-100.dat']

#Define a vector with the bands 
#In this case
#K2 - K2 C5 long cadence data
#G  - ARCTIC data
#SC - K2 C18 short cadence data
#band1 - MUSCAT i data
#band2 - MUSCAT r data
#band3 - MUSCAT z data
bands = ['K2','G','SC','band1','band2','band3']

#Pyaneti is able to deal with multi band with a different cadence for each band
#In this example K2 C5 data was observed in long cadence (29.425 min) we need to resample the model
#All other bands do not need resampling
#We need to define t_cad, a vector indicating the integration time (in units of days), 
#each element has to correspond to the bands defined in bands variable
#Note that when no resample of the model is needed, the value that we put in t_cad is not important, but we still need to give a value
t_cad = [29.425 / 60. / 24.0,1.5 / 60. / 24.0,1.5 / 60. / 24.0,1.5 / 60. / 24.0,1.5 / 60. / 24.0,1.5 / 60. / 24.0]
#Vector indicating the number of steps to integrate the model, each element has to correspond to the bands defined in bands variable
#We only integrate the model for the K2 C5 long cadence with 10 steps
n_cad = [10,1,1,1,1,1]

#This variable controls if we want to fit a single radius for all bands or a radius fit for each band
#If False (default) pyaneti will fit a single planet radius for all bands
#If True  pyaneti will fit a planet radius for EACH band, this might be useful to check if the planet radius is consistent within all bands
is_multi_radius = True

#MCMC controls
#the thin factor for the chains
thin_factor = 5
#The number of iterations to be taken into account
#The TOTAL number of iterations for the burn-in phase is thin_factor*niter
