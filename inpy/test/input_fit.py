#Input file for test problem for pyaneti
#Created by Barragan O.
#This file contains the basic parameters to change for simple pyaneti run
#There are more flags which can control the input/output of the code
#They can be found inside src/default.py, all the flags inside this file
#can be changed inside the input file.
